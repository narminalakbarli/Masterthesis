# Essential Thesis Code Snippets

This folder contains thesis-ready code excerpts as **text windows** (Markdown fenced code blocks) with short explanations.
Use these to build `Code 4.1`, `Code 4.2`, etc. in Word.

Suggested mapping:
- `01_data_split.md` → Code 4.1
- `02_feature_engineering.md` → Code 4.2
- `03_preprocessing_pipeline.md` → Code 4.3
- `04_imbalance_smote.md` → Code 4.4
- `05_model_training_eval.md` → Code 4.5
- `06_reproducibility_config.md` → Code 4.6
