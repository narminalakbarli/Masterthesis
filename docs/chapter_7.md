# Chapter 7 — Conclusion and Future Work

## Methods and future experiments discussed

- Consolidates findings across feature engineering, balancing, and model families.
- Identifies limits and future directions such as:
  - richer deep temporal modeling,
  - broader anomaly and semi-supervised learning,
  - stronger explainability/fairness governance,
  - production-grade online/stream evaluation.

## Implementation check

- The codebase now includes explicit runnable blocks for the main experimental pillars claimed in the thesis.
- Remaining future-work areas are mostly advanced governance and deployment extensions rather than missing core replication experiments.
